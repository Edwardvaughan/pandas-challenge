Module 4 homework (what I managed to complete).
Program PyCitySchools: a program which gives district and school summaries for fifteen schools, the five best- and lowest-performing schools by overall passing rate and average math and reading scores by grade for all schools.  It's written in Python 3.11.  Across all findings, math scores are lower than reading scores (no reading score was below 80 %, unlike math scores).  Students find this the harder subject.  The two best-performing schools by overall passing rate are Cabrera and Griffin High Schools.  Griffin 10's average math score of 84.4 % is bettered only three times, Griffin 11's average reading score of 84.54 % only four times.  The lowest-performing school is Rodriguez High School.  Rodriguez 11's average math score of 76.47 % is the third lowest across all grades and schools.  Rodriguez 12's average reading score of 80.49 % the second lowest.  Another failing school is Figueroa High School.  These schools need improvement.
